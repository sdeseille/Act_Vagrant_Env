# Act_Vagrant_Env

Purpose of this project is to share **Vagrantfile** file and all necessary steps in order to build an [Act](http://act.mongueurs.net/) server from scratch with vagrant.

Act is A Conference Toolkit by Philippe Bruhat and Ã‰ric Cholet used in a lot of Perl conferences. 
See [README](https://github.com/book/Act/blob/master/README) from Act.

Vagrant is a solution to create, portable and reploducible development environment that i found really useful.
